      The start of his academic career was at the University of Bath in Psychology and
      Communication Engineering, later moving into Electrical Engineering and co-authoring
      a handful of publications on artificial intelligence, ending up with a Ph.D. in

      He gained insight into applying these skills in business and academia including:
      copy-editing course text for Power System Economics; working as a cameraman;
      helping teach media skills to various executives; and leading the development of a
      tech-startup. Since then, his focus has been on training and behaviour change.
