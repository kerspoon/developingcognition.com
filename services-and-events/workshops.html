      <p>
        This course will give participants knowledge and practice of using a clear
        and evidence-based decision making process, allowing them to overcome many
        of the biases and pitfalls that lead to bad decisions. Depending on requirements
        the course can be tailored to rapid, high-pressure decisions or careful and
        deliberative ones, as well as towards either individual or group decision making.

      <h2 class="vertical-rhythm--small">Action plans <small>(MCII / WOOP)</small></h2>
      <ul class="text-muted nav nav--keywords vertical-rhythm--small">
        <li>individuals</li>
        <li>businesses</li>
        <li>schools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many plans we set do not get completed, this course aims to change that. The course
        covers breaking bad habits and forming good ones, completing aversive tasks (ones
        you know you should do but keep putting off), change behaviours, and changing
        mindset. It pulls together research from motivation, procrastination, goal
        achievement, and behavioural economics into a clear and actionable form.

    <div class="vertical-rhythm--large">
      <h2 class="vertical-rhythm--small">How to start a startup</h2>
      <ul class="text-muted nav nav--keywords vertical-rhythm--small">
        <li>individuals</li>
        <li>businesses</li>
        <li>schools (17+)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Startups are not like large companies, they need a different mindset and different
        behaviours. People who attend this course will have a clear idea of what is important,
        and thus how they should spend their time when starting one of their own. It is based
        upon Sam Altman’s lectures, The Startup Owner's Manual, The Lean Startup, and Zero to
        One.

    <span class="anchor" id="memory">&nbsp;</span>

    <div class="vertical-rhythm--large">
      <h2 class="vertical-rhythm--small">Remembering information</h2>
      <ul class="text-muted nav nav--keywords vertical-rhythm--small">
        <li>individuals</li>
        <li>schools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remembering facts and understanding concepts is something that people find hard, but it
        shouldn’t be. After this course attendees will know exactly what they need to do to
        remember any information. It does this through teaching how memory works - introducing
        spaced repetition learning, cognitive load theory, and chunking.

    <span class="anchor" id="time-management">&nbsp;</span>

    <div class="vertical-rhythm--large">
      <h2 class="vertical-rhythm--small">Prioritisation and time management <small>(using agile/scrum)</small></h2>
      <ul class="text-muted nav nav--keywords vertical-rhythm--small">
        <li>individuals</li>
        <li>businesses</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using ideas from agile software development and scrum attendees will be able to create a
        realistic and valuable time plan either for themselves or for a small group. This covers
        estimating the size of tasks, prioritising them and retrospectives for continual
        improvement.

        <li>schools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        School students who attend this course will be able to better appreciate why homework is
        important, why they often leave it to the last minute, and create achievable action plans
        to overcome their main causes of procrastination.
