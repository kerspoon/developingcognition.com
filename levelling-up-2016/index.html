          ideal thing to help you get on top of new year's resolutions, to

        <h3>What will I actually be doing?</h3>

        <p>
          This course is meant to be practical so, in addition to learning about
          the subjects we will give you techniques to improve happiness, create
          strong habits, meditate, and communicate better.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example in the "Achieving Goals" workshop you will learn the best
          tools from the last two decades of research into goals and habits,
          then we will each practice using those tools to turn vague aims like
          "get fitter" into a strong action plan that you are likely to stick
          to.
        </p>

        <h3>Is this course right for me?</h3>

        <p>
          It doesn't matter what stage of your career you are or whether you
          are into "self-development" or not. As long as you have a desire to
          change a habit, learn something new or become happier then this is for
          you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Collectively we have taught everyone from students to corporate
          businesses. If you are still not sure then feel free to drop us a line

          Each workshop will give you something different. In each you will have
          a chance to understand where and when to use these skills and practice
          using them. The instructors will be available all day to answer your
          questions and help you through you roadblocks.
