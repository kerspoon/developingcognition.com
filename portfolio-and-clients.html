        Tasked with improving a core engineering module for 600 undergraduates. This involed a review and
        improvement of the course evaluation questionnaire; and the creation of pre-lecture checklists for
        students.These changes were used for formative evaluation by the faculty and to improve
        metacognitive learning for the students.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, to increase engagement and understanding, we setup and ran usability tests of the
        eLearning (Moodle) site by observing and interviewing students.
