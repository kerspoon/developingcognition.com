        Tasked with improving a core engineering module for 600 undergraduates. This involved a review and
        improvement of the course evaluation questionnaire; and the creation of pre-lecture checklists for
        students. These changes were used for formative evaluation by the faculty and to improve
        metacognitive learning for the students.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, to increase engagement and understanding, we setup and ran usability tests of the
        eLearning (Moodle) site by observing and interviewing students.

        A 3-hour workshop on avoiding procrastination and completing homework delivered
        to 16 to 18 year old students in the Centre for Applied Sciences at City and
        Islington College.
      </p>

      <p>
        This workshop used mental contrasting and implementation intentions (WOOP) along with
        a modified 'homework wrapper' to provide ongoing help and support for students. It was evaluated
        using the procrastination quotient​ and qualitative teacher feedback.

      <p>
        Half day interactive behavioural safety workshops entitled "The Psychology of
        Behaviour". Its aim was to build a collective responsibility to improve the
        working environment and safety culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scenario based workshops bring together the entire workforce in small
        cross-disciplinary teams to identify personal risk triggers and create an
        environment where safety is an automatic habit, not a check-box procedure.
